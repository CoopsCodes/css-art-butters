# CSS Art

## South Park - Butters edition

Welcome fam,

This is my first attempt at cracking open the wide world of CSS Art.

South Park has been chosen based on my passion for the show, and also the general simplicity of the characters, I figured it would be a great place to start.

Following along from a CSS Master [Jhey Tompkins](https://twitter.com/jh3yy) and inspired by my fellow Coder Academy graduate [Lou](https://twitter.com/flangerhanger) I wanted to use this as a chance to really study CSS in depth.
